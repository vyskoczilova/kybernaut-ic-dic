== Frequently asked questions ==

= I want to display values in Woo iDoklad by Vladislav Musílek (Toret) =

Go to `Toret plugins -> Woo iDoklad` and scroll to `Přiřazení polí pro IČ a DIČ` and fill following values:
IČ: `_billing_ic`
DIČ: `_billing_dic`
SK DIČ: `_billing_dic_dph`

= I want to style ARES verified fields =
U can use css selectors `.kbnt-validating`, `.kbnt-ok`, and `.kbnt-wrong` for example:
`.kbnt-wrong input {
    color: #e2401c;
}
.kbnt-ok input {
    color: #0f834d;
}
.kbnt-validating input{
    color: #3d9cd2;
}`

= I want to display fields in the same row, one besides other (half width) =

You can use this snippet to modify the classes of outputed fileds, just add them to your functions.php

`add_filter( 'woolab_icdic_class_billing_ic', 'my_theme_class_billing_ic', 10, 1 );
function my_theme_class_billing_ic ( $class ) {
	return array('form-row-first');
}

add_filter( 'woolab_icdic_class_billing_dic', 'my_theme_class_billing_dic', 10, 1 );
function my_theme_class_billing_dic ( $class ) {
	return array('form-row-last');
}`

= I want to update customers meta when I change IČO or DIČ value within order edit. =

You can use this snippet to update customers data when you edit an order, just add them to your functions.php

`add_filter( 'woolab_icdic_update_user_meta', '__return_true' );`

= I want to use the latest files. How can I do this? =

Use the GitHub Repo rather than the WordPress Plugin. Do as follows:

1. If you haven't already done: [Install git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

2. in the console cd into Your 'wp-content/plugins´ directory

3. type `git clone https://github.com/vyskoczilova/kybernaut-ic-dic` or better type `git fork https://github.com/vyskoczilova/kybernaut-ic-dic`

4. If you want to update to the latest files (be careful, might be untested on Your WP-Version) type `git pull´.

= I found a bug. Where should I post it? =

I personally prefer GitHub, to keep things straight. The plugin code is here: [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/kybernaut-ic-dic)
But you may use the WordPress Forum as well.

= I found a bug and fixed it. How can I contribute? =

Either post it on [GitHub](https://github.com/vyskoczilova/kybernaut-ic-dic) or—if you are working on a cloned repository—send me a pull request.
